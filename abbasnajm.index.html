<h2><i>History of  Technology</i></h2>
<div 
style="padding-left:10pt; font-size:20pt">

<p>The history of technology is the history of the invention of <em>tools and techniques</em> and is one of the categories of world history. Technology can refer to methods ranging from as simple as <strong>stone tools to the complex genetic engineering </strong>and information technology that has emerged since the 1980s.</p>
<h2><i>Technological Change</i></h2>
<p>

<dfn>Technological change, </dfn>defined by economists as a <u>shift to a new production function resulting from an increase in the efficiency of a product or process</u>, is the main source of economic growth. In strictly economic terms technological change is presented as a positive transformation that often arrives in waves of related innovations. <code>Geographers,</code> in contrast, are more cautious about technological change because they are also concerned with social and environmental impacts. The rise of<kbd> patent activity</kbd> and the associated search for technology rents has led to the differential impacts of intellectual property on cities and regions.</p><br><br>



<p style="color:red;"><small><samp><mark>Technological change has mixed environmental impactsâ€”some positive and some negative, that are frequently hard to assess in the short run.</samp></mark> Meanwhile it has required increasing inputs of both private and public capital aimed to capturing technology rents that have promoted greater wealth inequalities</small><p/></div>
